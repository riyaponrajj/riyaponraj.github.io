## 🧠 About Me
I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **network measurement**, and **physical Internet infrastructure**.

My Ph.D. research focuses on **mapping traceroute signals to submarine cable segments** using:

- RTT delta embeddings  
- Contrastive learning  
- Geolocation uncertainty modeling  
- DNS token inference  
- Multi-basin physical topology structures

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📌 **Oceanus: Mapping Traceroutes to Submarine Cables**  
*Self-supervised contrastive learning for physical-layer inference.*

- Built the dataset (37.75M traceroutes, 695 cable segments)  
- Designed RTT-delta feature pipeline  
- Trained NT-Xent and triplet-loss embedding models  
- Achieved strong k-NN accuracy for cable identity prediction  
- Extracted subnet–cable homophily patterns
